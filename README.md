# Henon Attractor
A sketch using the Processing library of a 700 px by 700 px area around the origin of the HÃ©non map, where black represents convergence and white represents divergence.
The map can be altered by changing the *a* and *b* values. Try it out!
To increase accuracy, increase the *grain*.
